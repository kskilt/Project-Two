## Before we get started:
Open up your terminal and run command 'bundle install'. This will pull all of our gems necessary for running the program! Next run the command 'rails server' to host a server, and in your prefered web browser enter 'localhost:3000'. This will bring your right to our homepage and we can get started! Have fun!


## Welcome to our Online Movie Manager.
 This rails program is perfect for adding new movies to our local theaters and create new show times for the movies. Our local theaters include many screening options, including Imax! To navigate, simply create a new user, at least 5 characters, and any password. Make sure to write your password on a sticky note and place on your monitor so you don't forget. For simplicity sake, I use the same password for all of my websites!

# Once you are logged in, feel free to navigate our theaters and movies by clicking on the proper options in our menu bar. At any point you will be able to click back to these options or even Home if you are lost. Inside our theater listings, you will see each theater with its location, number of screens, and whether Imax is available. Pick the best theater for your enjoyment.

1. If you know about a showing that we missed, simply visit that theater and click the link at the bottom to add a new showing time.
2. Everything is easy click options to avoid making a mistake, but if you do, you can also edit the showing by clicking on the link underneath the showing!
3. Last minute cancellation? You can remove a showing completely by clicking the 'delete button' under the showing.

# Movies is just as easy!
1. Click on the movies link at the top, and check out all the new movies we have added!
2. If you know something we don't, there is a button at the bottom to create a new movie.
3. Once a movie has left theaters and moved to DVD, feel free to click the delete button and remove it from our listing.
4. Lastly, we aren't perfect, and just like the showings, we left an option to edit the movie under its description. Simply correct the form and click update!

# Thank you for visiting and hope you enjoy this management tool!
